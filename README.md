# Grow Your Garden - CSE 264
This is a message board style app geared towards artists who would like to show off their work or accumulate notoriety for comissions.

## Components
Each component will have its own folder and dedicated README with details on any requirements it has, and a step by step on how to get it running. The three main components are as follows:
1. Server
    1. A must for the client and admin interface to work. We will not be deploying this app, so the server must be run locally.
1. Client
    1. The web interface for the app.
1. AdminCLI
    1. Admin interface for the backend.

## Roles
These are the assigned roles:
* Natalie - Front End
* Mina - Back End / Git Manager
* Sawyer - Admin Interface

Please only change files in the your specific folder so that it is easier to merge. Always pull the most recent files from the other folders before you merge.
