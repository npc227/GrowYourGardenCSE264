# Client Instructions
## Functionality:

### Posts:
The home page will display posts for the user's viewing pleasure. It will be formatted in groups of 8, set up as a grid (reminiscent of a garden plot). Clicking on an image will bring up the related post, including: artist, caption, comments, etc. Users may exit by clicking off of the post or an 'x' button on the corner. To view a different set of art / posts, there will be a refresh button. Each time it is pressed, it will bring a new set of posts to the home screen. If there are no new posts (in a given session), then an icon will display stating that all posts have been seen.

### Profiles:
User profiles will be accessed via login (for the user's) or by clicking on an artist's username in their post. Information will include their username, a bio, and recent posts.
